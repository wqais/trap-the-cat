# TrapTheCat
The project was developed in Java, as a part of CSE 108 (Object Oriented Programming Language Sessional) project.

The game can be played between two players in the same LAN. One player will be the 'Trapper' and 
the other player will be the 'Cat'. 

For multiplayer mode, run server/Server.main() in a PC located in the same LAN as the players. 
Then, run executables/Main.main() in both of the PCs of the players. All of these can be run in a single PC too. 
One has to create a game and wait. The other player has to join the game and the game starts.


The game can be played in single player mode too. Currently, one can play as 'Trapper' and try to trap the 'Cat'.
