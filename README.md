## Description
In "Trap a Cat", players engage in a strategic board game where one player acts as the trapper, aiming to corner the cat within the boundaries of the board, while the cat attempts to avoid being trapped. The game is played on a grid-based board, with the trapper strategically placing barriers to restrict the cat's movement

Creating the "Trap a Cat" game stemmed from a desire to offer players an enjoyable yet mentally stimulating experience. We wanted to provide a game that challenges players to think strategically and plan their moves carefully. Whether playing as the trapper or the cat, participants must devise tactics to outsmart their opponent. The game fosters an atmosphere of friendly competition and encourages players to engage in exciting battles of strategy. With its blend of fun and intellect, "Trap a Cat" promises hours of entertainment for players of all ages.
